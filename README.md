## General Information

I wanted to revamp my personal site in preparation for applying to jobs after a few months of traveling abroad. Thought it would be fun/creative/disturbing to make a 3D model of my head and use it to describe projects that I'm working on as well as have a clean place to showcase some of my past projects.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js v13.4.18
- react-three/fiber v8.13.7
- r3f-spline v1.0.2
- React Spring v9.7.3

## Features

Showcasing .glb and .gltf models using react-three/fiber and r3f-spline


## Project Status

Version 1: _complete as of 10/15/23_ 

## Issues

- Performance on the homepage can be improved. Will most likely run the models back through blender and decrease amount of vertices as some of te models imported from Spline have a ton

## To Do
| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| Add Store page | :x: |
| Fix homepage performance | :x: |


## Acknowledgements

Credit to [pmndrs docs](https://docs.pmnd.rs/) for the getting me the basics of r3f which is the center of this project.
